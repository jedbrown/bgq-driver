To build the open source Blue Gene software, perform the following steps.

The software is available in two tar files:
o bgq-V1R2M1.tar.gz
o bgq-V1R2M1-gpl.tar.gz

Both of these must be downloaded.


=== Download and Install Required Software ===

In addition to the Blue Gene software distribution, you must have these extra packages/software installed:

- Dojo 1.8.1

To build the Blue Gene Navigator administrative web application, you will need the Dojo JavaScript library.

Download Dojo from Dojo's site, http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.8.1/dojo-release-1.8.1.tar.gz .

In addition, you need to create an archive for the Navigator build.

$ mkdir dojo-repackage
$ cd dojo-repackage
$ tar -xzf dojo-release-1.8.1.tar.gz
$ mv dojo-release-1.8.1 dojo
$ tar -czf dojo.tgz dojo

Put dojo.tgz somewhere, such as /bgsys/dowloads.
When you configure, you will pass --with-dojo=/bgsys/dowloads/dojo.tgz (or wherever you put it).

- JSDoc Toolkit

To build the Blue Gene Navigator administrative web application, you will need the JSDoc toolkit.

Get JSDoc from http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/

Put the jsdoc_toolkit ZIP file in a directory like /bgsys/downloads.
When you run configure during the build, you will pass --with-jsdoc=/bgsys/downloads/jsdoc_toolkit-2.4.0.zip

- IBM XL Compiler
 
To build the "comm" component, you will need the IBM XL compiler installed on the system in
/opt/ibmcmp/vacpp/bg and /opt/ibmcmp/xlf/bg.  Refer to installation instructions that come
with the XL compiler.

- Other packages from RHEL

Other packages from the RedHat Enterprise Linux distribution may need to be installed.
One package that is required but not commonly is librdmacm-devel.

This package can be installed using yum if you have a RHEL repository configured:
# yum install librdmacm-devel


=== Scratch Database ===

A database in DB2 is used during the build of the Blue Gene open source software.
This scratch database is called BGDB0SCR by default.
The system that you build on must have the BGDB0SCR database cataloged.
To create the database, use the following commands:

$ su - bgqsysdb
$ mkdir ~bgqsysdb/data/ts
$ cd  ~bgqsysdb/data/ts
$ db2 "CREATE DATABASE bgdb0scr PAGESIZE 8192"
$ db2 connect to bgdb0scr user bgqsysdb using db24bgq
$ db2 "create bufferpool bp3scr size 100000 pagesize 16k"
$ db2 "create tablespace userspace3scr pagesize 16k managed by system using ('/dbhome/bgqsysdb/data/ts') extentsize 64 prefetchsize 32 bufferpool bp3scr overhead 7.5"
$ db2 "alter bufferpool bp3scr size AUTOMATIC"
$ db2 "create temporary tablespace userspace3scrtemp pagesize 16k managed by system using ('/dbhome/bgqsysdb/data/tsscr') extentsize 64 prefetchsize 32 bufferpool bp3scr overhead 7.5"


=== Building ===

When the system has the required software and configuration, build the source code by by running the following steps:

Un-tar the two tar files in the same directory, the second will add more files to the directories created by the first un-tar.
$ tar -xzf bgq-V1R2M1.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf bgq-V1R2M1-gpl.tar.gz

$ cd bgq-V1R2M1

$ scripts/configure \
 --with-floor=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor \
 --with-dojo=/bgsys/downloads/dojo.tgz \
 --with-jsdoc=/bgsys/downloads/jsdoc_toolkit-2.4.0.zip \
 --with-revision=1 \
 --with-db=yes \
 --with-security=yes

$ make


Once complete, the binaries and libraries are in the "work" directory.
