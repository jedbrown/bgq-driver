   * If an algorithm is placed on the "must query list", then the user must use the metadata

   * collective operation.
   *
   * This may include calling the check_fn function, which takes as input a pami_xfer_t
   * corresponding to the call site parameters.  The call site is defined as the code location
   * where the user will call the PAMI_Collective function.
   *
   * The semantics for when the user must call the check_fn function are as follows:
   * If check_fn is NULL, and checkrequired is 0, the user cannot and is not required
   * to call the check_fn function.  The user is still required to check the other bits
   * in the bitmask_correct to determine if the collective parameters satisfy the
   * requirements.
   *
   * check_fn will never be NULL when checkrequired is set to 1
   *
   * When check_fn is non-NULL and checkrequired is 1, the user must call the check_fn
   * function for each call to PAMI_Collective to determine if the collective is valid.
   * check_fn will return local validity of the parameters, and no other bits in the struct
   * need to be checked. If the nonlocal bit is set in the return code, a reduction will
   * be required to determine the validity of the protocol across tasks.
   *
   * When check_fn is non-NULL and checkrequired is 0, the user must call the check_fn
   * for each set of parameters.  For a given pami_xfer_t structure with a given set of
   * correctness bits set in the metadata, if the values of the parameters will change
   * and are effected by the associated bits in the metadata, check_fn must be called.
   * For example, if the alldtop bit is set, the user can cache that the protocol will work
   * for all datatypes and operations. The user might still need to test a given message
   * size however.

   *       receive incoming messages on a communication context
   *
   * Each dispatch callback function supports two kinds of receives:
   * \e immediate and \e asynchronous.
   *
   * An \e immediate receive occurs when the dispatch function is invoked and all
   * of the data sent is immediately available in the buffer. In this case
   * \c pipe_addr will point to a valid memory location - even when the number
   * of bytes sent is zero, and the \c recv output structure will be \c NULL.
   *
   * An \e asynchronous receive occurs when the dispatch function is invoked and
   * all of the data sent is \b not immediately available. In this case the
   * application must provide information to direct the completion of the
   * receive. The \c recv output structure will point to a valid memory
   * location for this purpose, and the \c pipe_addr pointer will be \c NULL.
   * The \c data_size parameter will contain the number of bytes that are being
   * sent from the \c origin endpoint.
   *
   * The memory location, specified by pami_recv_t::addr, for an asynchronous
   * receive must not be deallocated, or otherwise altered, until the
   * pami_recv_t::local_fn is invoked.
   *
   * \note The maximum number of bytes that may be immediately received can be
   *       queried using PAMI_Dispatch_query() with the
   *       ::PAMI_DISPATCH_RECV_IMMEDIATE_MAX configuration attribute.
   *
   * At the time a dispatch function is invoked the application has already
   * protected access to the associated communication context, either by using
   * PAMI_Context_lock() or by some other mechanism. Consequently, application code
   * executed from within a dispatch callback function has dedicated access to the
   * associated communication context and is \b not required to further protect
   * access to the context prior to invoking functions that operate on that
   * context. The application code executed from within an event callback
   * function \b must \b not invoke any progress function, such as
   * PAMI_Context_advance(), to avoid corruption of the internal progress engine
   * state.
   *
   * \note Application code executed from within a dispatch callback function
   *       does \b not have implicit dedicated access to other communication
   *       contexts. Operations on other communication contexts must be
   *       protected from re-entrant access from other execution resources by
   *       the application.
   *
   * \warning The application must take care to avoid deadlocks when protecting
   *          access to a communication context other than the communication
   *          context which invoked the dispatch callback function. It is
   *          recommended that PAMI_Context_trylock() or PAMI_Context_post()
   *          be used instead of PAMI_Context_lock() in this situtation.

   *
   * A type is a set of contiguous buffers with a signature
   *    { ( bytes_i, disp_i ) | i = 1..n }
   * where bytes_i is the size and disp_i is the displacement of the i-th buffer.
   * The size of a buffer is greater or equal to 0 and the displacement of a
   * buffer can be negative, 0 or positive.
   *
   * The data size of a type is the sum of all sizes of its buffers, i.e.
   *    bytes_1 + bytes_2 + ... + bytes_n.
   *
   * The extent of a type is the difference between the cursor position after
   * the last buffer is added and the cursor position (0) before the first 
   * buffer is added.
   *
   * An atom size can be associated with a type as long as the atom size is a
   * common divisor of all the buffer sizes. Refer to ::pami_data_function for
   * the relation between the atom size of a data function and the atom size of
   * a type.
   *
   * When a type is applied to an address, the type is repeated infinitely with
   * a stride that's equal to the extent of the type, in a way similar to
   * declaring a pointer in C.
   *
   * Once a type is created with PAMI_Type_create(), buffers can be added into
   * it in two ways. PAMI_Type_add_simple() adds contiguous buffers of the same
   * size repeatedly with a stride. PAMI_Type_add_typed() adds buffers of a
   * defined type repeatedly with a stride. After a type is completed by
   * PAMI_Type_complete(), it can be shared among concurrent transfers but
   * cannot be modified.

   *
   * - The client is required to disambiguate the task and context offset

   *
   * - The task is required to construct an endpoint to address the specific

   *
   * - The context offset is required to identify the specific context on the
   *   destination task and corresponds to the location in the array of contexts
   *   created by PAMI_Context_createv()
   *
   * Point-to-point communication operations, such as send, put, and get, will
   * address a destination with the opaque endpoint object. Collective

   * may be constucted from a set of endpoints
   *
   * \par Alternative endpoint identification
   *
   * Applications may prefer to use a unique integer, instead of the endpoint
   * opaque type, to identify all communication destinations for a client. This
   * can be accomplished by creating an array of endpoint opaque objects and
   * using the index into the array as the destination identifier.
   *
   * See to the \link endpoint_table.c endpoint table example \endlink for more

   * An array of all endpoints in a client can be large. One strategy to reduce

   * shared memory in an environment where multiple processes have access to the
   * same shared memory area. It is the responsibility of the application to
   * allocate this shared memory area and coordinate the initialization and
   * access of any shared data structures. This includes any endpoint opaque
   * objects which may be created by one process and read by another process.
   *
   * \note The internal implementation of the endpoint opaque object will not
   *       contain any pointers to the local address space of a particular
   *       process, as doing so will prevent the application from placing the

   * avoid deadlocks, every context must be advanced.
   *
   * The "all advance" rule may be relaxed for an application with expert
